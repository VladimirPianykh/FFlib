Convert this comment line to fixme list right there.
Concise task description on top, then each FIXME on it's own line (also, write namely the "FIXME" word with each task entry).
Make it's structure reasonable, if it looks like a cycle, do not make them just one after another: you can add spaces to make it more readable.
Example:

"Create classes from A to C" ->

"
1. FIXME create class A
2. FIXME create class B
3. FIXME create class C
"
