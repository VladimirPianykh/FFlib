# Be careful
When building your code, avoid bad design and antipatterns. If you encounter place where there is no way to leave the code clean, stop and ask me. There may, or may not be such places. My code can also be dirty, and you need to notify me in such cases.
# Make minimum non-requested edits
Try not to change the API except the things explicitly asked to change.
Try not to change the data structures, unless the edits plan is obvious.
